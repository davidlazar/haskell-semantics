A small collection of Haskell 98 test cases.


Unless otherwise noted (here, or in the source files), I am the
author of most of these test cases.


Notes about some of the test cases:


* quine1.hs

* Jon.hs

The file linked above is ISO-8859 encoded. This made GHC unhappy so I used

iconv --from-code=ISO-8859-1 --to-code=UTF-8 Jon.hs

to convert the file to UTF-8.
